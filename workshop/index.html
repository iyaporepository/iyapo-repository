Players must then each write a short description of an object that fits the constraints of the prompt.

                    <p>Iyapo Repository is a resource library that exists in a nondescript future. The library was founded to preserve the digital history and legacy of people of African descent. The repository derives its name from Lilith Iyapo, a prominent figure in Octavia Butler&#39;s Xenogenesis series. In Butler&#39;s narrative, Lilith Iyapo epitomizes the solitary human survivor, navigating the intricacies of three distinct and intricate worlds, past, present, and future.</p>

                    <p>Repository founders, Salome Asega and Ayodamola Okunseinde assume the roles of chief conservators at the library, collaborating closely with a diverse global team of conservators and archivists to oversee the expansion and maintenance of the ever-growing collection of artworks and historical objects. Through a series of mobile workshops and exhibitions, participants and attendees actively engage as archivists, aiding in the continual discovery, interpretation, and enhancement of the artifact inventory.</p>

                    <p>Archivists meticulously complete official Field Notes documenting each artifact, preserving these records within our Manuscript Division. These meticulous notes serve as foundational guides for the assembly, retrieval, and restoration of artifacts that then reside in the Art &amp; Artifact Division. Utilizing the archivists&#39; detailed records, Asega, Okunseinde, and repository conservators diligently work to conserve each artifact to its original state, ensuring its suitability for display within the main collection.</p>

                    <p>Beyond the Art &amp; Artifacts Division and Manuscript Division, the library comprises distinct specialized sectors devoted to Rare Books, the Moving Image, and Special Projects. Within the Moving Image Division, a diverse array of short videos curated by various filmmakers provide contextualization for the featured artifacts. Meanwhile, the Rare Books Division houses a collection of literary works that have served as essential references throughout the library&#39;s development. Lastly, the Special Projects Division is home to artifacts that have been either unearthed or reinterpreted by scholars invited to explore the repository&#39;s archives.</p>

                    <p>The Iyapo Repository workshops are deeply influenced by Speculative Design, drawing inspiration from The Thing From the Future game, works by Dunne and Raby, and projects by the Extrapolation Factory. Participants in the workshop step into the shoes of archivists, charged with the mission of uncovering, deciphering, and revealing artifacts from the field. This process is supported by a specific workshop methodology.</p>
